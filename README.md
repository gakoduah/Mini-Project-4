## 🔍 Key Features  

### 📈 Volatility Models Implemented  
1. **Custom Switching Model** - Simulates abrupt volatility regime changes  
2. **Heston Model** - Mean-reverting stochastic volatility with correlation effects  
3. **GARCH(1,1)** - Captures volatility clustering phenomena  

### 📊 Performance Analysis  
- Comparative metrics (RMSE, Max Drawdown) for delta vs. vega hedging  
- Regime-specific strategy optimization  
- Greeks exposure tracking  

### 🎨 Interactive Tools  
- 3D volatility surface visualizations  
- Real-time hedging dashboard  
- Animated hedging process simulations
